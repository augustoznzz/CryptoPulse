# Overview

This is a comprehensive cryptocurrency market analysis tool built in Python that performs multi-timeframe technical analysis to generate trading signals. The system analyzes a specific cryptocurrency against USDT using advanced technical indicators and mathematical models to determine optimal entry points, take-profit targets, and stop-loss levels for both LONG and SHORT positions.

The tool integrates real-time data fetching from cryptocurrency exchanges, applies sophisticated technical analysis across multiple timeframes (1h, 4h, 1d), and generates structured trading recommendations with risk management parameters including leverage suggestions.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Output format: Exact Portuguese/Brazilian format with emojis as specified in requirements.
Exchange priority: Automatic fallback system (Coinbase → Kraken → Binance → Bitfinex → Demo mode).
Demo mode: Available for testing when exchanges are unavailable.

# System Architecture

## Core Components

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**Main Orchestrator (`CryptoAnalyzer`)**
- Coordinates the entire analysis workflow
- Manages component initialization and data flow
- Handles multi-timeframe analysis coordination

**Data Layer (`DataFetcher`)**
- Abstracts cryptocurrency exchange interactions using CCXT library
- Supports multiple exchanges (Binance, Coinbase) with fallback mechanisms
- Implements rate limiting and error handling for API calls
- Fetches OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data across different timeframes

**Technical Analysis Engine (`TechnicalIndicators`)**
- Implements comprehensive technical indicators including SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands
- Uses NumPy and Pandas for efficient numerical computations
- Incorporates advanced mathematical models like linear regression and ARIMA for price forecasting
- Calculates volatility metrics and risk assessments

**Signal Processing (`SignalGenerator`)**
- Processes multi-timeframe indicator data to generate trading signals
- Implements Fibonacci retracement calculations for target setting
- Determines signal strength and direction across timeframes
- Calculates entry points, take-profit levels, and stop-loss positions

**Utility Layer (`utils`)**
- Provides formatting functions for price display with appropriate decimal precision
- Implements mathematical helper functions for Fibonacci targets
- Handles price formatting based on asset value ranges

## Design Patterns

**Dependency Injection**: Components are initialized with their dependencies, allowing for easy testing and modularity.

**Strategy Pattern**: Different exchanges and analysis methods can be swapped without changing core logic.

**Observer Pattern**: Verbose logging system allows for debugging without modifying core functionality.

## Data Flow Architecture

1. User specifies cryptocurrency symbol via command-line interface
2. Data fetcher retrieves historical price data from configured exchange
3. Technical indicators are calculated across multiple timeframes
4. Signal generator analyzes indicators to determine market direction
5. System outputs formatted trading recommendation with specific entry/exit points

## Error Handling Strategy

- Graceful degradation when exchange APIs are unavailable
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported exchanges
- Comprehensive logging system for debugging and monitoring
- Input validation for cryptocurrency symbols and parameters
